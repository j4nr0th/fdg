Domain Types
============

To help with generating :class:`CoordinateMapping` and :class:`SpaceMap` objects
based on more common ways to define domains by linearly interpolating between
its boundaries, a few helper types are provided to allow for 1D and 2D deformed
domain generation. To see an example of how these work, see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_domains.py`.
