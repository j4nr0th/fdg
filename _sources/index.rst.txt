``fdg`` documentation
=====================

The ``fdg`` Python module exists to allow working with differential geometry
objects, mainly :math:`k`-forms, which are defined in terms of finite number
of degrees of freedom. As such the acronym ``fdg`` stands for "Finite Differential Geometry".
It is intended to serve as a basic building block that can be used to construct
element matrices for FEM solvers. It also provides types that can help with
post-processing of the computed results.
